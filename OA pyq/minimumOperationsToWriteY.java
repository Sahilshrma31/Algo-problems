/**
 * LeetCode 3071. Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 * -------------------
 * You are given an odd-sized n x n grid where each cell contains a value in {0,1,2}.
 * You want to transform the grid so that:
 *   1. All cells that form the shape of the letter 'Y' have the same value.
 *   2. All cells that do not belong to the 'Y' shape have a different value.
 * 
 * In one operation, you can change the value of any cell to either 0, 1, or 2.
 * Return the minimum number of operations required to achieve this configuration.
 * 
 * The 'Y' shape consists of:
 *   - The two diagonals from the top row to the middle cell.
 *   - The vertical line from the middle cell down to the bottom row.
 * 
 * Example:
 * --------
 * Input: grid = [[1,2,2],
 *                [2,1,2],
 *                [2,2,1]]
 * Output: 3
 * 
 * Explanation: Make the 'Y' cells all = 1, and non-'Y' cells = 2 with 3 operations.
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Time Complexity (TC): O(n^2 * 6) = O(n^2) 
 *   - For each of the 6 possible (y, notY) assignments, we check all n^2 cells.
 * 
 * Space Complexity (SC): O(1) 
 *   - We only use a few integer counters, no extra DP arrays.
 * 
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
