    ðŸ”¹ Shortest Path in Graph with Unit Weights (BFS)

    ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:
    Given a graph with N nodes (0 to N-1) where all edges have weight = 1,
    find the shortest path from a given source node 'src' to all other nodes.
    If a node is unreachable, mark its distance as -1.

    Example:
    N = 6
    Edges = [(0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
    src = 0

    Adjacency List:
    0 â†’ [1,2]
    1 â†’ [0,3]
    2 â†’ [0,4]
    3 â†’ [1,5]
    4 â†’ [2,5]
    5 â†’ [3,4]

    Output:
    dist = [0,1,1,2,2,3]

    Explanation:
    - Distance from 0 â†’ 1 = 1
    - Distance from 0 â†’ 2 = 1
    - Distance from 0 â†’ 3 = 2 (via 1)
    - Distance from 0 â†’ 4 = 2 (via 2)
    - Distance from 0 â†’ 5 = 3 (via 3 or 4)


    ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
    - Since all edges have equal weight (1), we donâ€™t need Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
    - BFS works because it explores nodes level by level â†’ 
      the first time we visit a node, it's guaranteed to be the shortest path.
    - Maintain a distance array initialized to infinity.
    - Update distance when a node is reached with fewer steps.

    ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:  O(N + M)
        - N = number of nodes
        - M = number of edges
        - Each node & edge is processed at most once.

    ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity: O(N + M)
        - Adjacency list storage + BFS queue + distance array
